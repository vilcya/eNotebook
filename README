 eNotebook SATE2012 MicroProject
 by Maulik Patel and Vilcya Wirantana
 
 Organizes a student's eDailies, eTecnotes, and 257's. 
 The student can create a new eDaily and browse their old ones using
 the server database as a middle-man. 
 
 
 TO DO LIST: 
 High Priority:
 - Threading or AsyncTask for loading pages 
 	- Especially when connecting to the internet (257's, downloading eDailies, etc.)
 - Finish eTecNotes - figure out how to pass PDF and display them
 - Database Interaction for 257's
 
 Low Priority:
 - Currently, as a quick fix, the user is logged out when the Splash page starts 
 	(Fix this to make the user log out when the entire application is closed)
 - Finish or delete the Splash page
